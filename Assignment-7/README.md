<p> In this Assignment I have built a symbol table from the given programme file using Yacc as LALR(1) parser with lex as token generator. This parser with symbol table generator is in very basic stage so there are many un handled cases.. So it may give abnormal result or can say bad words like "syntax error".</p>
